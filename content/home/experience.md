#### Data Science Intern @ Capital One (2023 & 2024):
	Keywords: fraud detection, model building, feature selection, high dimensional data
	- Designed and implemented a complementary model to capture missed instances of fraudulent applications
	- Created 69 features from biometrics data to enhance main fraud detection model

#### Data Science Intern @ DocuSign (2021):
	Keywords: A/B testing, frequentist experimental design, Bayesian experimental design
	- Implemented internal computation tool to conduct experimental analysis through Bayesian approach by integrating previous observational data and experimental data
	- Built in-house tool using Streamlit to determined experiment sample size and duration given desired statistical power and treatment effect

#### Data Science Intern @ Viasat (2020):
	Keywords: competitive intelligence, clustering/representation learning, data collection, geographical data
	- Created method that downsizes household population to a representative, comprehensive subset by using density-based clustering method (DBSCAN) to identify households addresses
	- Captured information on competitor internet service pricing plans in regions by surveying such selected households addresses

#### Undergraduate Research @ UCLA HeartBD2K Lab (2018-2020):
	Keywords: data imputation, feature selection, deep learning
	-  Processed molecular data by identifying proteins present in both treatment groups and imputing missing values using MICE
	- Performed feature selection to extract proteins sequences linked to heart diseases using Linear SVM, LASSO, and Elastic Net
	- Implemented unsupervised deep learning and conventional modeling methods to cluster proteins based on time-series biological data

#### Oncology Bioinformatics Intern @ Pfizer (2019):
	Keywords: graph representation learning, high-dimensional data, pre-clinical/clinical data
	- Created a network from high dimensional multi-omics data that models gene and proteins relationships through linear regression and multi-layer perceptron
	- Employed an autoencoder to extract molecular features significant in diﬀerentiating breast cancer cell lines from other cancer types
