#### About me ##

Hello! I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at UCLA. My research focuses on causal learning, graphical models, and latent variable modeling with applications to RNA-seq data. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~zhou/index.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Qing Zhou</a>. Before my Ph.D. studies, I obtained a B.S. in Computational Mathematics and minor in Statistics from UCLA.

#### Research areas ##

  - Causal machine learning: 
    - Devising algorithms to determine causal and effect relations from obs. data
    - Using conditional independence tests, non-parametric model selection methods, and graph properties to infer the existence and directionality of causality
  - Graphical models:
    - Modeling and representing variables relations under fully observed variables and possibly unobserved variables through graphical models
  - Latent variable modeling:
    - Creating methods to (1) distinguish between confounding vs causal relations, (2) infer feasibility of finding causal effect, and (3) determining the causal direction
